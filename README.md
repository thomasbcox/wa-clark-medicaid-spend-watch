# 🔍 WA Medicaid Spend Watch v2.0 (Clark County)

An open-source, civic oversight platform designed to identify statistical anomalies and risk signals in Medicaid spending.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Relational Data Model**: Powered by **DuckDB** for lightning-fast analytical queries over multi-gigabyte datasets.
- **Enriched Provider Registry**: Combines CMS Medicaid spend data with **NPPES** metadata (Specialties, Names) and **OIG LEIE** exclusion lists.
- **Anomaly Detection Engine**:
  - **Peer Benchmarking**: Identifies outliers by comparing providers against their specific specialty peers.
  - **Rule-Based Screening**: Detects extreme price deviations (e.g., >3x peer avg) and revenue concentration.
  - **Unsupervised ML**: Uses **Isolation Forest** algorithms to surface multivariate outliers.
- **Exploratory Dashboard**: A lightweight FastAPI + JS frontend for journalists and watchdogs to investigate risk signals.

## 🛠 Project Structure
